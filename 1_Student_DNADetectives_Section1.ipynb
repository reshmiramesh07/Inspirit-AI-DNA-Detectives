Different variants have been discovered so far, including the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and P.1 (Gamma) variants. These variants might flip certain nucleobases (A, U, C or G) to change the behavior of their spike proteins, or drop nucleobases in certain spots, referred to as a *deletion*. Mutations such as these may cause a variant to be more infectious or dangerous.
